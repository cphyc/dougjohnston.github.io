title: Book Review - The Modern Web
---

Every industry evolves and changes over time. New techniques are adopted,
radical theories are introduced, and better tools are made available. And
because no one wants to be left behind, the successful practitioner devotes
time and energy to keeping their knowledge and skills up to date. Ideally, this
drive to keep current is all about one's passion for their field, but if
we're being honest, it's also about a desire to be  seen as relevant and also
to be competitive in future job markets.

This all holds true for web developers, it's just that the rate of evolution
and change is about 800 times faster than in any other industry. By it's very
nature, technology moves quickly, but the mass adoption of smartphones,
tablets, smart TVs, and even [smart smoke

newest product") in recent years has made the cutting edge more elusive than
ever. 

In some ways, the Web 2.0 days were easier. Maintaining IE6 compatibility
was a bitch, but there were only a handful of browsers to worry about and
a single 960-pixel grid layout did the trick. Today, we have to code for
desktop and mobile browsers. Thankfully standardization has improved
and we have more flexible tools at our disposal. But new tools bring new
choices and new decisions to be made.


 The technologies behind each of these products, which we use on a daily
basis, are changing at such a rapid pace that it can be difficult to keep up.
