title: Interactive Python
---

Python has been on my list of languages to learn for several years. But up
until a few months ago, I had never taken the time to even look at the docs.
Coming from Ruby, I guess it always felt too similar. Improving my JavaScript
skills seemed like a better way to spend my time. But, back in October, I
happened upon the Intractive Python course at Coursera and decided to give it
a try. Now, I've watched plenty of standalone instructional videos (railscasts,
peepcode, etc.), but prior to October, I hadn't participated in a structured
educational couse since college.

Coursera's Interactive Python course (taught by a handful of wiley CS
professors from Rice University) appealed to me for a number of reasons:

* Online learning is all the rage these days and I wanted to see what it was all about.
* Python has been on my list of languages to learn for several years.
* The course is based on building games in Python. I'd never done any real game development and it seemed like another cool thing to learn.
* The course was free.

Just yesterday, I finished my final program for the class - a fun little game
based on Atari's 1979 classic, Asteroids (view my version of the game - just
click the 'play' button). In many ways, the original Asteroids is still better,
but building the game did teach me all about animation, collisions, and how to
code a simple physics engine. I knew about these concepts at a high level, but
had no real world experience with them.

In addition to learning the basics of game development, I was taught the basics
of Python along the way (see item #2 above). As the course is designed for
beginner-level programmers, there wasn't much that was new to me, but I still
found value in learning a bit of "The Python Way". Can I now be as efficient
in Python as in Ruby? No, but I have added another tool to the toolbox. I'll
likely still choose Ruby whenever I can, but I'll no longer shy away from
Python code.

Lastly, some comments about the sturcture of the course and the online
learning environment in general. The Coursera site itself felt very
full-featured. It's still a little rough around the edges, but its ability to
offer video lectures, quizzes, projects, and community forums was appreciated
(by me at least).
